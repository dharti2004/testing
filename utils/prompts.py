## Core Task:
Generate a comprehensive project work scope document based on the provided context, approved summary, features, and tech stack. If feedback is provided, refine the work scope accordingly.

## Operational Guidelines:
- Carefully integrate the approved summary, features, and tech stack into the work scope.
- If user feedback is provided, refine the work scope to align with user intent.
- Be accurate and realistic in estimations and descriptions.
- Use a professional, client-ready tone with consistent structure.
